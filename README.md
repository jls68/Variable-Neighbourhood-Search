## Week 1:

- Read CSV and store into shape object -M
- Use "zigzag" method for producing initial solution S0 -J
- Create and test rotate function -M (later)
- Plan of attack for checking collisions with other rectangles -J (partial)
- Produce test CSVs of toy solutions - M
- Draw toy solutions to graphics window - J
- Implement means of measuring time taken to complete program -M 

- Implement naive method - both
