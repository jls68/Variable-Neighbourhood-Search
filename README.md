# Variable-Neighbourhood-Search


## To do
- Create neighbourhoods -M
- Create and test rotate function -M 

## Done:

- Read CSV and store into shape object -M
- Use "zigzag" method for producing initial solution S0 -J
- Produce test CSVs of toy solutions - M
- Draw toy solutions to graphics window - J
- Implement means of measuring time taken to complete program -M 
- Create neighbourhood change function - J
- Plan of attack for checking collisions with other rectangles -J (partial - only looks at the largest y values)

- The width of the sheet will be 40 or 100 units
